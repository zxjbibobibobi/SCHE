# Learning from Massive Highly Imbalanced Data via Hybrid-sampling with Self-paced Curriculum  
![SCHE-process](https://github.com/zxjbibobibobi/SCHE/assets/57565621/a7ca65e5-76db-4d50-a3fd-8ad7e809f9fd)

This paper proposes a novel imbalnaced learning framework: Self-paced Curriculum Hybrid-sampling based Ensemble (SCHE), for massive highly imbalanced data classification.

The **Experiments** folder contains the scripts we use for performance evaluation on **CheckerBoard**, **Small-scale Real-world** and **Massive Highly Imbalanced** Datasets.

The implementation details of SCHE is in self_paced_curriculum_ensemble.py.

The reproductivity details of the demonstration in the paper are also contained in our code:3.

Due to limited time, we haven't well organized the whole structure of our project. Soon we will make the code friendly to run.

Wish you a happy day!
