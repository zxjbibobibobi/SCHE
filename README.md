# Learning from Massive Highly Imbalanced Data via Hybrid-sampling with Self-paced Curriculum  
![overview](https://github.com/zxjbibobibobi/figure/blob/main/SCHE/overview.png)
This paper propose a novel imbalnaced learning framework:Self-paced Curriculum Hybrid-sampling based Ensemble (SCHE).


The **Experiments** folder contains the scripts we use for performance evaluation on **CheckerBoard**, **Small-scale Real-world** and **Massive Highly Imbalanced** Datasets.


The implementation details of SCHE is in self_paced_curriculum_ensemble.py.
