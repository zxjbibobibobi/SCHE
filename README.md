![overview](https://github.com/zxjbibobibobi/figure/blob/main/SCHE/overview.png)
This paper propose a novel imbalnaced learning framework:Self-paced Curriculum Hybrid-sampling based Ensemble (SCHE).
The utils.py file includes reproductivity information of conducted experiments. Our implementation of SCHE is contained in self_paced_curriculum_ensemble. SCHE_test is used for performance evaluation.
